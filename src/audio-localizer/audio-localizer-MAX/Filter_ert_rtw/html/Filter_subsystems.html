The following table:
<ul>

<li> provides a mapping from the non-virtual subsystems in the model to
functions or Reused functions in the generated code and 

<li> notes exceptions that caused some non-virtual subsystems to not reuse code
even though they were assigned a Reuse Setting ('RTW System Code' entry 
on the Subsystem Block Dialog) of 'Auto' or 'Reused Function'.

</ul>

The following section provides details on each exception that caused
a non-virtual subsystem with a Reuse Setting of 
<ul>

<li> 'Auto' to become an inlined code segment, 

<li> 'Auto' to become a non-reusable function without arguments, or

<li> 'Reused Function' to become a non-reusable function without arguments.

</ul>

<B>Note</B>: This section does not report graphically identical non-virtual
subsystems marked as 'Auto' that were not reused due to differences in their
functional properties (such as dimensions, datatypes, work vectors, parameters,
etc.).  You may identify reasons for non-reuse in such cases by
inspecting the differences in the functional attributes of the
subsystems in the model or in the inlined generated code.
